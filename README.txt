Dataset used :Fashion MNIST  dataset. Dataset is trained and classified using a "numpy"  Feed forward Neural Network.
This folder contains the code base for Assignment 1 as part of CS6910: Deep Learning Fundamentals course 
at IIT Madras Jan-May 2021.The problem statement involves building and training a 'plain vanilla' Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch using primarily Numpy package in Python.
Steps:
1.All codes are written inside Assignment1.ipynb. User need to open Assignment1.ipynb gppgle collab notebook and set the values of hyperparameters in config dictionary and perform wandb sweep to get the best set of hyperparameters .
2.Once hyperparameters are identified, user can use the hyperparameters  to generate the confusion matrix and have good understanding about the accuracy of the trained model.
