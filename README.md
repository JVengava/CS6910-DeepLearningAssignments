Dataset used :Fashion MNIST  dataset. Dataset is trained and classified using a "numpy"  Feed forward Neural Network.
This folder contains the code base for Assignment 1 as part of CS6910: Deep Learning Fundamentals course 
at IIT Madras Jan-May 2021.The problem statement involves building and training a 'plain vanilla' Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch using primarily Numpy package in Python.
Steps:
1. User need to open Assignment1.py and set the values of hyperparameters in config dictionary and perform wandb sweep to get the best set of hyperparameters .
2.Once hyperparameters are identified, user can use the hyperparameters in test.py to generate the confusion matrix to understand the accuracy of the trained model.
